] make heap dynamic

] remove recursive collection-capability flag unmarking, add some better.
	eg. temporary index of non-collectable scms? unnecessary if we add
	some other flags...

] NULL is internally used as 'nil' but what we do when returning NULL children?
	(yeah, i mean frames and lists)
	--> return something else!

] make two frame classes:
	* one for global vars, hashed, allows real symbol addition
	* one for locals, where hash table is not the thing we ooh really want,
	  because the stacks would grow terribly. adding of bindings to this
	  won't be really supported, but bypassed by adding another smaller
	  child frame.
	
	Oh god! if someone would implement rb-trees on this!

	note: other implementations don't even solve fast lookups in local
	frames, so it would also be nice just to make a slist of it.
	(it would also behave similarly logical)
