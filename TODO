] make heap dynamic

] remove recursive collection-capability flag unmarking, add some better.
	eg. temporary index of non-collectable scms? unnecessary if we add
	some other flags...

] NULL is internally used as 'nil' but what we do when returning NULL children?
	(yeah, i mean frames and lists)
	--> return something else!
