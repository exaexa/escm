] make collector heap dynamic 
	(at least growable to some defined extent, maybe non-continuous)

] remove recursive collection-capability flag unmarking, add some better.
	eg. temporary index of non-collectable scms? unnecessary if we add
	some other flags...

] come up with some reasonable hash function for hashed_frame.
	(and then code it)

] What the hell should happen, when we run out of memory?!
	should THAT be allowed? sould we free some memory and run an exception?

] oooh that^ reminds me - someone should think about exceptions. :D

] possibly - symbol and text are just fucking similar, what if they had
	a common ancestor;)
