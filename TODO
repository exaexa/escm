] make collector heap dynamic

] remove recursive collection-capability flag unmarking, add some better.
	eg. temporary index of non-collectable scms? unnecessary if we add
	some other flags...

] NULL is internally used as 'nil' but what we do when returning NULL children?
	(yeah, i mean frames and lists)
	--> return something else!

] come up with some reasonable hash function for hashed_frame.
	(and then code it)
