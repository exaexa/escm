	general escm todo


] check and add mark_collectable to evary new_scm usage

] come up with some reasonable hash function for hashed_frame.

] make collector heap dynamic 
	(at least growable to some defined extent, possibly non-continuous)

] What the hell should happen, when we run out of memory?!
	should THAT be allowed? should we free some memory and run an exception?
	Guess that allocating nil is really not the best idea we have.

] oooh that^ reminds me - someone should think about exceptions. :D
	we should have *error-hook*, which is lambda and (error) which
	calls it a little. Default *error-hook* lambda is internal and causes
	some kind of continuation crash;)

] that fucking lambda-continuation problem. Adding another combination
	of register seems a bit unnecessary, so solve it better way.
	problem: no one can really pop the lambda-cont before it finishes
	(garbage collector), and no one is able to tell what does it do
	with cont. stack. Solve it mathematically. ;)
