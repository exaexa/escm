Q: 
	Is there any tutorial for embedding ESCM in my application?
A: 
	Look at `src/interp.cpp' in this package, there's an implementation of
	complete interpreter using libreadline (which gives bash-like features).
	It should come well-commented so that any experienced-enough programmer
	understands it.


Q:
	How can I add functions and/or variables to my ESCM environment?
A:
	Look at `include/macros.h', there are some macros that could possibly
	help you. File `src/builtins.cpp' contains all the scheme internals
	implemented, so you can gain inspiration there. Basically, writing a
	lambda is a very simple process:

	You want to call it this way:

		(write-teh-numz)

	So you write the function, with use of one macro:
		
		#include "path_to_escm/macros.h"

		static escm_func_handler(thenums) {
			for(int i=0;i<1000;++i)printf("%d\n",i);
			return_scm(NULL);
		}

	return_scm(NULL) means that you don't return anything, in scheme that
	will be seen as returning the () empty list. `static' keyword is not
	necessary here, but it can be usuable when writing larger projects.

	Then, if you have your environment
		
		scm_env* e;
		//....
	
	you have to "register" the function, or, put the reference to the global
	variable frame.

		escm_add_func_handler(e,"write-teh-numz",thenums);

	...and then you can use it!

	Any other object can be added to environment using the add_global method
	of scm_env:

		e->add_global("variable",new_scm(e,number,5)
				->collectable<scm>())
	
	in a result, scheme will evaluate correctly:

		(* variable 2) => 10


Q:
	How can I guess which environment was my C++ function called from?
A:
	Every function declared with escm_func_handler macro has the caller
	environment accesible via escm_environment local variable. This can be
	used for memory allocation (which you will most probably need.)

	This is an example of function that always returns #t:

		escm_func_handler(foo) {
			return new_scm(escm_environment,boolean,true)
				->collectable<scm>();
		}

	When writing larger handlers, this will most probably help:
		
		#define e escm_environment   // :D


Q: 	
	How do I manipulate internal scheme data?
	How do I create scheme data type of my own?
A:
	Every scheme-related data in escm is represented as a class derived from
	the very basic scm class. Generally, the data is created this way:

		scm_env*e; 
		//...

		scm*a=new_scm(e,string,"foobar!");

	This creates new object on scheme heap, with a type of string, filled
	with foobar. As all scheme objects are garbage-collected, this object is
	initially protected, so it doesn't get deleted accidentally before you
	bind it somewhere, so the garbage collector can "reach" it (and
	therefore decide that it won't be deleted).

	You may want to mark the object as collectable after you set some
	assignment to it:
		
		e->add_global("aaa",a); 
		/*now, that the object is referenced by the global frame,
		  it is reachable for the collector and won't be deleted by
		  accident. */

		a->mark_collectable();
		/* If the string gets out somehow, gc can delete it. */

	For user convenience, expression-like collectable-marking was added:
		
		return a->collectable<string>();

	or you can combine it even like this:
		
		return new_scm(e,string,"returned string") ->
						collectable<string>();

	Please note that collectable-marking is recursive, so when you possibly
	had scheme object like this:

		(1 . (2 . (3 . (4 . 0))))
	
	You don't have to mark all 4 pairs, but only the first one (with '1'),
	and other get marked properly because they're children of the first
	pair.
	
	In ESCM we have several such string- and pair-like "basic" types:
		
		-- C++ class	-- scheme expression

		number		123
		string		"hello"
		character	#\a
		boolean		#t #f
		pair		(1 . 2) (1 2 3 4)
		closure		(lambda (foo) foo)
		NULL		()
	
	Please note that we work only with pointers to these classes, never
	directly. There are several more classes to handle scheme internals,
	those include class frame, continuation, lambda, macro, and derivees.

	NOTE: we will describe work with macros later.

	You may work with classes through pointers, you can see file 
	`include/types.h' to see what every class contains. You can work with
	number class this way:
		
		number *a;
		//.....
		a->n=23;
	
	Constructors of the classes are closely related to the new_scm macro we
	have seen earlier. For example using

		new_scm(e,type,foo,bar)
	
	will allocate the memory for `type' in heap that belongs to scm_env e, 
	and then will call a constructor:
		
		type(foo,bar)

	Destructors are properly called, too, but the time of object deletion is
	rather unpredictable - so for example having some `printf's in ~type
	destructor will make the program throw the lines on garbage collection,
	which can be years after the objects were really used. On the other
	hand, this can be interesting to observe. (measure how many % of your
	objects get redundant, or just to do some statistics)


	Please note that because of principle of garbage collection, when your
	custom scheme object refers to another garbage-collected scheme objects,
	it has to be able to mark those objects as it's children. This is done
	with the scm* get_child(int) function. Every scheme object has to have
	one, and every such function has to behave in this way:

	1] if it's called with a number n, it returns pointer to n-th child.
	2] if it's called with a higher number, it returns constant
	   escm_no_more_children.
	
	Usually the function gets called sequentially with values increasing
	from zero. You must not return any pointers that point on anything other
	than the class scm's derivee, but you can return NULL.

	You can see some examples of get_child() functions in `include/types.h'
	file.

	If you need some memory allocation in the scheme machine, you can use
	classical C/C++ memory allocation methods, and if you need the data on
	the escm's heap (so it can get stored to a file or something), you can
	use the data scheme this way:

		a=new_data_scm(scm_env_pointer,size)

	and access allocated data with dataof() macro, for example:

		memcpy(dataof(a),pointer,size);


	With all of this in mind, creating a garbage-collectable class is pretty
	simple. Look, for example, at header of class for letters.

		class character: public scm
		{
		public:
			char c;
			inline character (scm_env*e, char a) : scm (e)
			{
				c = a;
			}

			virtual std::string display_internal (int style);
		};

	scm_env*e is passed to the constructor because of need for more
	construct-time allocations.
	
	Notice the display_internal() function - it formats an object to some
	human-readable form and returns it in std::string from STL. When style
	is 0, then it's formatted like scheme source code, otherwise it's
	formated for standart output. For example:

		 style --	-- type		-- output string
		
			0	character	#\a
			0	string		\"oh hai"
			1	character	a
			1	string		oh hai
	
	To get garbage-collection working well, you have to code correct
	get_child function. For example, class pair could look like this:

		class pair : public scm {
		public:
			scm *a, *d;

			virtual scm* get_child(int i) {
				switch (i) {
				case 0: return a;
				case 1: return d;
				default: return escm_no_more_children;
				}
			}
			
			// ...

		};


Q:
	How do I get data from/to a functions?
	How do I get function arguments which were passed to C++ code?
	How do I return value from a C++ function to scheme?
A:
	Arguments which the function was called with can be retrieved with
	macros defined in `include/macros.h'. Those are:

		-- macro		-- usage

		arg_count		count of arguments, without tail 
					argument

		has_arg			true if there's one or more "classical"
					argument available
		
		pop_arg()		pops that argument

		has_tail_arg		true if the next argument is "tail"

		pop_tail_arg()		pops it

		pop_arg_type(T)		pops the corresponding argument, but
		pop_tail_arg_type(T)	returns NULL if it's not of type T.

	Note, classical and tail arguments mean roughly this in scheme:

		(function classical-arg classical-arg . tail-arg)
	

	To return a value from the function, use return_scm macro:

		return_scm(new_scm(e,boolean,true));

	This is not a "real return", function code may continue even below the
	return_scm macro, but do not try to return any other value. (because you
	would most probably cause the next function in call-stack to return that
	value, which could bring not-really-interesting results)


Q:
	How do I use macros?
A:
	Macros differ from functions in some ways:

	1] when you call a macro, the arguments don't get evaluated.
	2] macro gets the arguments in one list, does something with them,
	   evaluates to a value, and this value is then evaluated again.
	
	Simple explanation for non-schemers: Macro is a code generator. It gets
	something, creates a scheme code, and that code then gets evaluated.

	In ESCM, the code can be generated by another scheme code, or by some
	C++ function.

	Macro in scheme code looks like this:

		(macro (a form) (cdr form))
		(a + 1 2 3) => 6

		; this is equivalent definition:

		(define a (macro (form) (cdr form)))

	Note that macro is called with its whole syntax, so this would create an
	endless loop:
		
		(macro (a form) form)
		(a)

		; => (a) => (a) => (a) => ...

	
	In C++, macro can be defined just like the function. We can implement
	macro from above:

		escm_macro_handler(a,code)
		{
			return_macro_code(code->d);
		}

	You might NOT want the interpreter to evaluate things you created, and
	use it as a result of whole operation - then you need to play with the
	continuations a little. There are several macros defined that way:

		#define e escm_environment

		escm_macro_handler(lambda,code)
		{
			pair* c = pair_p (code->d);
			if (!c) e->throw_exception (code);
			return_scm (new_scm (e, closure,
				c->a, pair_p (c->d), e->cont->env)
				->collectable<scm>() );
		}

		escm_macro_handler(begin,code)
		{
			e->replace_cont (new_scm 
				(e, codevector_continuation, pair_p (code->d) )
					 ->collectable<continuation>() );
		}

		escm_macro_handler(quote,code)
		{
			if(pair_p (code->d) ) 
				return_scm (((pair*)(code->d))->a);
		}


Q:
	How can I see what error occured?
A:
	ESCM has classical scheme error mechanism. You may define *error-hook*
	to set desired error-handling behavior.

	For example, when using the interpreter:

		> (macro)
		 => ()

		> (define (*error-hook* . x)
		 | (display "error: ")
		 | (display x)
		 | (newline))
		 => *ERROR-HOOK*

		> (macro)
		error: bad macro syntax
		 => ()

		> (define 123 4356)
		error: ("invalid define symbol format" 123)
		 => ()

	R5RS scheme features like catch/throw and error stack should be defined
	in scheme initialization file.

Q:
	How do I catch escm errors?
	How are the exceptions implemented in escm?
A:
	Simply, as in every scheme. There should be *globally* defined variable
	*ERROR-HOOK* (with asterisks), which is lambda. Every exception
	generated by internal escm code, embedded code, or (error) call is then
	fed to it. For example you might have noticed that "clean" interpreter
	doesn't really print out error messages. Fix is simple:

		(define (*error-hook* . x)
			(display "error: ")
			(display x)
			(newline))
	
	Notice that argument has variable length, so anything can be passed to
	this.

	Implementing some other error-handling stacks depends on your choice.
	Default escm interpreter should come with some solution.


Q:
	How do I generate an exception?
A:
	From scheme code, lambda (error) is predefined in default builtins, you
	may use it this way:

		(error 'any 'description 'here)

	Note that error is lambda, so arguments get evaluated before throwing.

	When implementing some builtin C++ function, you may use any of scm_env
	provided member error generators:
		
		void scm_env::throw_exception (scm* s)
		void scm_env::throw_string_exception (char* s)
		void scm_env::throw_desc_exception (char*desc, scm* s)
	
	All those do the same thing - throw an exception which is then usually
	passed to *error-hook*. You can safely emulate their behavior using
	C++ exception mechanism, mostly because escm exceptions are built upon
	that one. You should also be careful if you try to write some code that
	catches (scm*) - if it calls _any_ escm code, it must be prepared to
	catch its exceptions and probably forward them by another throw.

	So, generally, example definition of builtin (error) should be
	sufficient to explain all of this:

		
		void op_error (scm_env*e, scm*arglist)
		{
			e->throw_exception (arglist);
		}

	Macros for exception handling similar to the parameter handling macros
	found above should be implemented as well, self-explainable from file
	`include/macros.h'
