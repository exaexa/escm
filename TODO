] make heap dynamic
] scm_env copy constructor. (note: need to aviod pointer mess.
	maybe copy frames as lists?)

] OK, we need some way to allocate objects derived from scm
	probably working solution:
	scm::new(size_t, scm_env*) 
	question: will it work? (after inherited)

	another solution:
	macro:
	new_scm(return,scm_env,type) expands to 
	new(scm_env.allocate(sizeof(type)))type;
	cons --- alloc  ------------------ cons

	some other possible solutions?
